# OfficeQA

[OfficeQA](https://github.com/databricks/officeqa) ([dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/officeqa),
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08655)): questions about U.S. Treasury Bulletins (1939–2025) whose answers are
figures found in the bulletins, often after a computation. This example runs OfficeQA Full (246 questions) as the
[SkillOpt paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.23904) does: its 50 / 24 / 172 train / validation / test split, each
question's parsed source pages in the prompt, and exact match. It trains the agent's skill, the adapter's
`ADAPTER.md`, with the GEPA and SkillOpt methods, with ReHarness a bank of reflections retrieved below that skill, and
with Meta-Harness Adapter whole adapters written by a coding-agent proposer (Codex harness only), and compares them
with no skill and with SkillOpt's initial skill, in both of the paper's harnesses: direct chat, with read and grep
tools limited to the question's source files, and Codex, a `codex exec` session with the whole corpus. The same
methods, Meta-Harness Adapter aside, are run a second time with Codex and GPT-5.6-Luna acting and learning on a
ChatGPT login, the second column of the [Results](#results) table.

## Setup

Install the framework first ([Installation](../../docs/get-started/installation.md)) with the `skillopt` and `gepa`
dependency groups (pip 25.1+). Also needed: the gated Hugging Face dataset `databricks/officeqa` (`officeqa_full.csv`,
and `treasury_bulletins_parsed/` with `transformed/` and `jsons/`), and the key of the models' backend: for the default
(GLM 5.3 Flash acting, GLM 5.3 learning, on Fireworks) `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`. `model=<backend>/<model id>` on the
command line moves the agent, `llm=...` the learner ([Model backends](../../docs/guides/model-backends.md)). The Codex
harness also needs Docker, set up once as in the [recipe](../../docs/recipes/officeqa.md#run-in-the-codex-harness).

```bash
python -m pip install -e . --group skillopt --group gepa
python examples/officeqa/utils/prepare.py --csv /path/to/officeqa_full.csv --docs /path/to/treasury_bulletins_parsed
```

`prepare.py` writes the questions, the paper's split, SkillOpt's initial skill (`utils/seed_adapter/`) and a link to the
corpus (`utils/documents`, what the agent's sandbox is granted) to `utils/`.

## Run

The two columns of [Results](#results) are two sets of configs: each method's `run_codex_flash.yaml` or
`stream_codex.yaml` (GLM 5.3 Flash acting and learning) and its `run_codex_luna.yaml` or `stream_codex_luna.yaml`
(GPT-5.6-Luna acting and learning), the same protocol with the models changed. Both run in the Codex harness, which
needs Docker, set up once as in the [recipe](../../docs/recipes/officeqa.md#run-in-the-codex-harness).

#### GLM 5.3 Flash with Codex CLI 0.162.0

```bash
export OFFICEQA_CODEX_IMAGE=officeqa-codex:0.162.0
hermit train --config examples/officeqa/gepa/run_codex_flash.yaml                                        # GEPA
hermit train --config examples/officeqa/skillopt/run_codex_flash.yaml                                    # SkillOpt

hermit eval  --config examples/officeqa/skillopt/run_codex_flash.yaml --adapter none                     # no skill
hermit eval  --config examples/officeqa/skillopt/run_codex_flash.yaml --adapter ../utils/seed_adapter    # initial skill
python examples/officeqa/meta_harness_adapter/make_seed.py                                               # Meta-Harness Adapter
hermit train --config examples/officeqa/meta_harness_adapter/run.yaml                                    # six rounds of two candidates
hermit eval  --config examples/officeqa/meta_harness_adapter/run.yaml --adapter final
python examples/officeqa/continual_harness/make_seed.py                                                  # Continual Harness
hermit train --config examples/officeqa/continual_harness/stream_codex.yaml                              # the 172 as one stream
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=... WM_PORT=3601 examples/officeqa/reharness/launch.sh stream_codex                    # ReHarness: the same stream
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=... SEED=0 WM_PORT=3591 examples/officeqa/harness2_stream/launch.sh                    # Harness²: the same stream
```

An adapter's accuracy is `mean_score` in `<method>/runs/<run name>/eval/<selector>/summary.json` (172 test
questions, one pass), where `<selector>` is `final`, `none`, `adapter` or a directory's name such as `seed_adapter`;
`--adapter adapter` evaluates the trained adapter included in the folder. A stream has no test split: its number is
the mean of `rollout.mean_score` over the steps of its run's `steps.jsonl` (step 0, the bootstrap, has none). A
smoke on a few questions: the folder's `smoke_codex.yaml` (`smoke.yaml` in direct chat), after `hermit check
--config ...` ([walkthrough](../../docs/recipes/officeqa.md#check-train-evaluate)). The same commands with `run.yaml`
(direct chat: SkillOpt's own rollout, GLM 5.3 as the learner, three passes) or `run_codex.yaml` (the Codex harness
with that learner) give the recipe's [direct-chat table](../../docs/recipes/officeqa.md#results).

ReHarness runs through its launcher: it puts the embedding model behind a loopback relay for the adapter's reader
(whose sandbox has no keys), writes `reharness/seed_adapter/` and starts `hermit train`, `eval` or `check` on
`reharness/<config>.yaml`; `launch.sh smoke check --no-probe`, `launch.sh smoke` and `launch.sh smoke eval` are its
check and smoke, `launch.sh run` and `launch.sh run eval` the train/test split (the 50 as one stream, then its bank
on the 172). The [recipe](../../docs/recipes/officeqa.md#reharness) explains the two protocols. Harness² runs
through its launcher too, which writes the stream's order and starts the editors' wire meter
([`harness2_stream/`](harness2_stream/)). Meta-Harness Adapter runs in the Codex harness only;
[`meta_harness_adapter/`](meta_harness_adapter/) describes its configs and records.

#### GPT-5.6-Luna with Codex CLI 0.164.0

Each `*_luna.yaml` is the Flash-row config above with the models changed and nothing else. The acting model runs on
Codex's built-in provider with the machine's ChatGPT login (`codex login` once, no API key:
[`utils/agent/codex_login.py`](utils/agent/codex_login.py) gives each session a copy of the login), the learner is
the same model behind a relay that answers each `llm` call with one Codex session
([`utils/agent/codex_chat.py`](utils/agent/codex_chat.py)), and Harness²'s editors are Codex sessions
([`harness2_stream/codex_proposer.py`](harness2_stream/codex_proposer.py)). The image with the machine's own Codex
and the egress proxy to chatgpt.com: the recipe's [A model on a ChatGPT login](../../docs/recipes/officeqa.md#a-model-on-a-chatgpt-login).

```bash
export OFFICEQA_CODEX_IMAGE=officeqa-codex:0.164.0 OFFICEQA_CODEX_PROXY=http://oq-egress-chatgpt:3128

Results use two settings:

- **Train/test split:** [GEPA](../../docs/methods/gepa.md) and [SkillOpt](../../docs/methods/skillopt.md) train one
  `ADAPTER.md` from SkillOpt's initial skill on 50 training questions, select on 24 validation questions, and evaluate
  the fixed final adapter on 172 test questions. Accuracies are means of four independent trainings, with one
  evaluation pass per final adapter. Configs: [`gepa/run_codex_flash.yaml`](gepa/run_codex_flash.yaml) and
  [`skillopt/run_codex_flash.yaml`](skillopt/run_codex_flash.yaml). [Meta-Harness
  Adapter](../../docs/methods/meta_harness_adapter.md) searches on the 50 training questions alone (no validation
  questions) and evaluates its best candidate once on the 172; one training, in the Codex harness the streams use
  ([`meta_harness_adapter/run.yaml`](meta_harness_adapter/run.yaml), [result](meta_harness_adapter/#result)).
- **Test streaming:** [Continual Harness](../../docs/methods/continual_harness.md) and
  [Harness²](../../docs/methods/harness2.md) each process the 172 test questions once in the same order,
  updating the adapter as they go, without a separate training split or access to judge verdicts. These
  scores measure performance during adaptation. See [`continual_harness/`](continual_harness/) and
  [`harness2_stream/`](harness2_stream/) for their protocols.

**ReHarness** ([`reharness/`](reharness/), [method](../../docs/methods/reharness.md)) keeps the initial skill as
the harness's text and learns a bank of reflections below it, five retrieved per question by Qwen3-Embedding-8B and
revised after it, with the acting model as its reflection and revision agents. Each session is Codex in a container
of its own through [`utils/agent/codex_agent.py`](utils/agent/codex_agent.py) (3,600 s wall clock, as the two
streams; GEPA's and SkillOpt's trainings used SkillOpt's own Codex harness with 180 s sessions), which deploys the
skill and the question's retrieved reflections as the session's `AGENTS.md`. Five retrieved reflections run past
Codex's default limit on `AGENTS.md`, 32 KiB, beyond which Codex silently drops the rest, so the ReHarness configs
raise it to 200 KiB (`project_doc_max_bytes: 204800`); no session's `AGENTS.md` reached it.

- **Test streaming** ([`reharness/stream_codex.yaml`](reharness/stream_codex.yaml)): the 172 in the same seed-0
  order as Continual Harness and Harness², each answered by the bank as it stands, no verdict to the learner
  (`feedback: false`: the reflection and revision agents read the trajectory and the answer, never the judge's
  verdict or the reference answer). One stream on 2026-10-28: **0.634**, 0.640 over the first 86 questions and
  0.628 over the last 86; paired against Harness²'s reference execution of the initial skill (0.576), +5.8 points
  [−1.2, +13.4] (26 questions won, 16 lost). 10.0 h (USD 2.43 of sessions, USD 4.81 of reflection and revision
  calls), no errors, no session timed out; 172 reflections of 8.8 K characters on average.

Paired differences with 95% intervals, each run's selection and cost, the Codex sessions' isolation and the
differences from the paper: the [recipe](../../docs/recipes/officeqa.md#the-flash-row).

The earlier direct-chat runs (`run.yaml`, `stream.yaml`: SkillOpt's rollout, three passes) are in the recipe's
[direct-chat table](../../docs/recipes/officeqa.md#results); they are not on this row.

The GPT-5.6-Luna column is the same methods with the model changed and nothing else of the protocol: Codex 0.164.0
with GPT-5.6-Luna acting and learning on the machine's ChatGPT login instead of GLM 5.3 Flash on Fireworks, the same
data, split, seed skill, judge, parameters, stream order and one pass (Meta-Harness Adapter was not run). It starts
22–23 points lower and gains more from every method, most from GEPA, SkillOpt and Harness², and almost all of the
gain is the answer's form: a check of every answer finds the share with the right value at 0.66–0.71 in every cell of
the column. What differs from the GLM
column, the intervals, the paired differences and the check: the
[recipe](../../docs/recipes/officeqa.md#the-flash-row-with-gpt-56-luna); the `*_luna.yaml` configs run it ([Run](#run)).
